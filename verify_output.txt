{"is_scam": true, "confidence": 0.99, "reasoning": "The message exhibits multiple scam indicators: 1) **Urgency and Threat**: The message claims the account is 'blocked,' creating a sense of urgency and fear. 2) **Suspicious Link**: The URL 'http://scam.com' is highly suspicious and does not resemble a legitimate bank or service provider's domain. Legitimate organizations rarely ask users to verify accounts via unsolicited links. 3) **Unexpected Request**: The request to click a link for verification is unexpected and aligns with common phishing tactics.", "scam_type": "phishing"}It seems there was a technical issue while trying to delegate the task to the **HoneypotAgent**. I will retry engaging the scammer shortly.

In the meantime, here’s a quick reminder:
**This is a confirmed scam (phishing attempt). Do not click the link or provide any personal/financial information.** If you received this message, report it to your bank or service provider immediately.
